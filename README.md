****📊 Stock Price Movement Prediction Using Transformers****

This repository contains two Transformer-based deep learning models for binary classification of stock price movements — with and without the use of technical indicators. The goal is to predict whether a stock's price will go up (BUY) or go down (SELL) the next day, using historical data from a 5-year dataset.

**📁 Files in This Repository:-**

🔹 Model_without_Technical-Indicators.py
A Transformer model trained using only the raw closing price (scaled) of stocks.

🔹 Model_with_Technical-Indicators.py
An enhanced Transformer model that uses technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) along with the price to make more informed predictions.

**🧠 Key Concepts Used:-**

🔹Transformer Encoder (using PyTorch)

🔹MinMaxScaler for scaling price data

🔹Binary Classification (Buy/Sell)

🔹ROC-AUC and Accuracy Metrics

🔹Monte Carlo Simulations for price forecasting

🔹Sharpe Ratio calculation for risk-adjusted returns

🔹Technical Indicators (in the enhanced model)

**📝 Requirements:-**

Ensure you have the following installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn torch

**📌 Dataset:-**

Make sure the dataset file 5yrdataset.csv is present in the same directory. The dataset should have the following columns:

🔹date

🔹Name (stock ticker)

🔹close

🔹open, high, low, volume (used in technical indicator model)

**▶️ How to Run:-**

1. Clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-transformer-prediction.git

cd stock-transformer-prediction

2. Run either of the two scripts:

python Model_without_Technical-Indicators.py

or

python Model_with_Technical-Indicators.py

3. Enter the stock symbol when prompted (e.g., AAPL).

**🔍 What Each Model Does:-**

✅ Common Features

Takes the past 30 days of data to predict the next day’s movement.

Outputs:

🔹Accuracy and ROC-AUC score

🔹ROC Curve

🔹BUY/SELL signal graph

🔹Model’s verdict (BUY/SELL tendency)

🔹Sharpe Ratio calculation

🔹Monte Carlo simulation of 100 future days over 500 simulations

🧩 Model 1: Without Technical Indicators

🔹Uses only the scaled closing price as input to the Transformer.

🔹Basic but effective for trend-based prediction.

🧩 Model 2: With Technical Indicators

🔹Adds RSI, MACD, EMA, SMA, Bollinger Bands, Momentum, etc., to the features.

🔹Designed to capture nuanced market signals.

🔹More complex and often more accurate.

**🧪 Output Example:-**

✅ Accuracy: 0.7350

✅ ROC AUC:  0.8142

📊 ROC Curve shows how well the model separates Buy vs Sell decisions.

🧠 Verdict for AAPL:

✅ Predominantly showing BUY signals recently.

Reason: The model identifies more upward movements following historical trends.

📈 Sharpe Ratio: 1.2305

Alpha (Risk-Free Rate): 5.00%

🔎 Sharpe Ratio > 1 suggests a good risk-adjusted return.

📉 Monte Carlo simulates 500 possible price paths based on historical returns and volatility.


**📊 Visualizations:-**

🔹ROC Curve: Performance evaluation.

🔹Buy/Sell Signal Plot: Indicates model decisions on historical price.

🔹Monte Carlo Simulation: Simulated future price paths.

**📚 Future Improvements:-**

🔹Integration with live data APIs (like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage)

🔹Use GPU acceleration for faster training

🔹Convert into Flask app or Streamlit dashboard

🔹Add cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

**💡 Notes:-**

🔹The Transformer model captures temporal dependencies in price trends.

🔹Adding technical indicators provides feature richness to the model.

🔹Always use financial models as decision support tools, not as guarantees.
